# Bimaru-Solver
by Pedro Curvo ([@pedrocurvo](https://github.com/pedrocurvo))

This project is a solver for the Bimaru Puzzle and was developed as a project for the course of Artificial Intelligence at Instituto Superior TÃ©cnico.  
The images used bellow and some ideas for constrains were given by playing the game on the app
_Sea Battle_ by _AculApps_ available on the [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/pt/app/sea-battle-unlimited/id6444275561?l=en) and [Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=ch.aculapps.seabattleunlimited&hl=en).

## 1. What is Bimaru?
A **Bimaru puzzle**, also known as **Battleship Solitaire** or **Battleships**, is a logic-based puzzle that involves filling a grid with ships while satisfying certain clues or hints provided. It is played on a rectangular grid, typically square in shape.  
The objective of a Bimaru puzzle is to place a fleet of battleships (or ships) within the grid, following specific rules. The grid is divided into cells, and each cell can either contain a ship segment or be empty. The ships in the puzzle are represented by connected segments, either horizontally or vertically, without touching each other.

The puzzle begins with some clues provided outside the grid, often represented by numbers. These clues indicate the number of ship segments in each row and column. The clues may be placed at the beginning of each row and column or at the end, and they indicate the length of the ship segments and their arrangement within the corresponding row or column.

To solve the puzzle, you must use deductive reasoning and logical thinking to determine the placement of ships based on the given clues.
The rules for placing ships are as follows:
- Ships cannot touch each other, not even diagonally.
- Ships cannot occupy cells filled by Water.
- Each row and column must have the exact number of ship segments as indicated by the clues.
- The ships should be arranged in a straight line, either horizontally or vertically.

Using the provided clues and following these rules, you gradually fill in the grid, marking ship segments and empty cells until the entire puzzle is solved. The challenge lies in deducing the correct placement of ships by considering the constraints imposed by the clues and the already filled cells.

Bimaru puzzles can come in various sizes and difficulty levels, ranging from small grids with a few ships to larger grids with numerous ships. They provide an engaging and enjoyable exercise for logical thinking and problem-solving skills.

This Project is a solver for the Bimaru Puzzle on a **10x10 grid** with the following ships: 
- **4** ships with size **one**
- **3** ships with size **two**
- **2** ships with size **three**
- **1** ship with size **four**

## 2. Input Format
You can create an Instance of this problem by providing a text file with the following format as example:
```
ROW 2 3 2 2 3 0 1 3 2 2
COLUMN 6 0 1 0 2 1 3 1 2 4
6
HINT 0 0 T
HINT 1 6 M
HINT 3 2 C
HINT 6 0 W
HINT 8 8 B
HINT 9 5 C
```
You should run the program with the following command:
```
python3 bimaru.py < filename.txt
```
In the example above, each line of the input file is explained below:

- ```ROW``` section:
Numbers represent clues for each row. Example:
```ROW 2 3 2 2 3 0 1 3 2 2```

- ```COLUMN``` section: Numbers represent clues for each column. Example:
``` COLUMN 6 0 1 0 2 1 3 1 2 4 ```

- Number of Hints provided. Example: 
``` 6 ```

- ```HINT```s: Each HINT is represented as "HINT row column symbol". Example:
``` HINT 0 0 T ```

- The possible values for rows and columns are integers ranging from ```0``` to ```9```. The top left corner of the grid corresponds to the coordinates (0,0).

- The possible values for hints are: ```W``` (water), ```C``` (circle), ```T``` (top), ```M``` (middle), ```B``` (bottom), ```L``` (left), and ```R``` (right).

## 5. Heuristic 

It's important to refer that this problem is a CSP (Constraint Satisfaction Problem), so the constraints are very important to solve the problem and allow a faster execution of the algorithm. Such that the program can run fast only using the Non-Informed Search Algoritms. Beyond that aspect, is important to refer that a kind of 'intrisic' heuristic was used during the construction of the program, since it only gives actions for the 'next' boat that is missing, starting by the larger one, this allows a faster execution and a reduction in memory. This is a kind of heuristic that is not used in the h(n) function, but it's important to refer it. One may think of it has a kind of 'pre-processing' heuristic where initial the h(n) for larger boat is small and infinity for the other ones. 

A side from that, some may implement an heuristic to choose the right boat from the same lenght ships that are not yet placed. While thinking about this, I thought about the following:
- Parts of the grid that match with parts of the ships that are not yet placed
- Probabilistic Density Distribution of the ships on the Grid
  
The first one is easier to implement, but the second one is quite a challenge, since this probability distribution is not static, it changes as the grid is filled. Since the goal of this project is to solve the puzzle, I decided to implement the first one with a static version of the second one, but for more information
about the second one, you can check the links bellow to have an idea of how probability distributions can be used to solve this problem or to win the normal battleship game.

## 6. Classes and Suctrure of the Code 
The code is divided into 3 main classes:
1. **BimaruState** representing states in the Bimaru problem/in the search algorithms.
2. **Board** representing the board of the Bimaru problem, in this case the 10x10 grid with the boards.
3. **Bimaru** which is a derived class from **Problem**. The **Problem** class is a part of the AIMA code,
and is used to represent a problem in the search algorithms. The **Bimaru** class is used to represent the
Bimaru problem, and is used by the search algorithms to solve the problem. The functions that are overriden are:
   - **actions(state)** - returns a list of all the possible actions that can be done in the current state.
   - **result(state, action)** - returns the state that is the result of doing the action in the current state.
   - **goal_test(state)** - returns true if the state is a goal state, and false otherwise.

The code works by creating a `Bimaru` object and then calling search algorithms on it. The steps involved are as follows:

1. Create a `Board` object using the given text file as input through the `Board.parse_instance()` function.
2. Create a `Bimaru` object (referred to as the problem) with the `Board` object as input. This creates a `BimaruState` object representing the initial state of the problem, assigned as `problem.initial`.
3. Define the number of expected ships as `problem.expected_ships`, which guides the board and assists in the `goal_test` function.
4. Create a list that tracks the number of ships already present on the board when constructing the initial state. Account for the possibility of pre-filled ships of unknown types (length 1 to 4).
5. Call the action function on the initial state within the search algorithm, generating a list of possible actions:
   - Optimize the search by providing actions for specific ship types rather than all possible actions. Start with the 4-ship, followed by the 3-ship, and so on.
   - Note that the first and last types of actions are created within the actions function to minimize time and effort. The 4-ships have fewer options, allowing for quicker creation. The 1-ship, although common, is processed last to check remaining empty spaces, which are relatively few.
   - Generate options for middle-sized ships at the beginning of the Bimaru problem creation since they are more complex and time-consuming. By creating all options initially and then filtering for valid ones, option creation time is reduced.
6. Call the result function on the initial state and action within the search algorithm, resulting in a new state:
   - Merge the board, increment the ship count, and fill water in affected columns and rows caused by the new ship, making them full.
7. The generated actions only include valid options, excluding those that violate restrictions.
8. The goal_test function checks if the number of ships on the board matches the expected number of ships, as only valid actions are added.
